# MyTIL
Welcome to my logbook, my TIL (Today I Learned) repository!

## About me:
I'm a 15-year-old developer passionate about computer engineering.

## My goal:
Explore the vast ocean of IT in a consistent yet sustainable way, exploring different branches of IT to find my path.

## My roadmap for the next 3 months:

-  **end-month project:** An automation bot

### Month 2: Web development (frontend)
-  HTML5 & CSS3 fundamentals
-  UI/UX design principles
-  **end-month project:** A personal "Linktree-style" landing page hosted on Github Pages

### Month 3: Systems & Security (Linux & Terminal)
-  Linux terminal navigation
-  Basic shell scripting
- **Challenge:** Complete the first 10 levels of *OverTheWire: Bandit*

## Repository structure:
Folders are organized by language and technology. Each file contains a small lesson, a snippet or a problem I solved.

- '/Pithon': Scripts, logic notes and bot experiments;
- '/Web': CSS snippets and HTML structures;
- '/CyberSec': Linux notes, Luau (my first languange) script analysis and security research;
- '/General': Reflections and study methodologies.

## Learning philosophy:
> *"Zero days at zero".*

Consistency and discipline are key. Even if I was helped by AI doing this roadmap, my intentions are REAL.
