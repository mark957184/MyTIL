# VS code basics
For these 3 months i'm going to use VS code to learn everything in my roadmap. VS code is a accessible and open-source code editor created by Microsoft. 
As VS code is probably one of the most user friendly code editor you could find, it's pretty easy to understand the interface and all mechanisms, anyway those are the most important concepts:
-  Setup;
-  File managing;
-  Extentions;
-  other (I'm still not 100% a code expert).

## Setup:
I started my journey downloading VS code and Python libraries, can be easily found on Google, and opening it.
I was a beginner, I think everybody started typing on a file created with "New file..." (ctrl + o) without knowing anything and wondering why it didn't work.
Guess what? the file extention, yea (↓ *File managing* ↓).
It was just like writing on a sheet of paper to throw away the next second.
This was one of the first things I had to "debug" in this journey, so I discovered you need to create the file properly to be able to write in a specific languange in it.

## File managing:
As said, you can't code in Python on a default file, you need to add an extention.
To do that just put it at the end of the file name, separated by a dot. (example: myCode.py, this is a file in Python language)
But before creating a file, we should create a clean folder where we can put all the work and stuff we do in VS code, so just open the explorer (ctrl + shift + e, first icon in top right) and open your folder in it.
This way your work can be easily opened from you and, in case a project require more than one file, from VS code, importing data from other files (from the same directory) in Python for example.

## Extentions:
Extentions are probably one of the most useful mechanic in VS code, in fact from there you can download things that makes you able to code in almost all languages.
Just search the languange you want and you get libraries and other useful stuff made from more expert developers so you don't have to.
For example, to be able to code in Python language you need to download some default extentions made from Microsoft.

With time you'll get used to VS code.
Language after language, debug after debug, it is (was and will be) a crucial tool in my IT journey.
