# OOP - Object-oriented programming
As I started learning Python, I wondered how it works, how it makes things like websites, databases and much more.
Curiosity is the base to improve and strengthen your logic thinking and knowledge, isn't it?
I learned that programming languages are divided by use, paradigms and others criteria.

Those groups of languages can be identified in macro-groups defined by **paradigms**, those are "styles" that all the programming languages that are in one of them follow.

If the programming languages in a paradigm were a tool for construction, for example, their paradigm whould be the architectural method you use to build a structure.
However, there are a lot of multi-paradigm languages too, such as Python, C++, Rust and others, that means those could be used for multiple reasons.
With that been said, there's a lot of those paradigms, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) it's one of those.

## Key concepts of OOP:
- **Encapsulation**: essentially data organization and hiding by gathering all data and putting it in classes, hidden from the outside world;
- **Abstraction**: grouping complex operations in simple functions that can be recalled, doing things step by step;
- **Inheritance**: the capability to have subclasses, smaller classes that inherit properties by it's parent (class) plus it's own properties too;
- **Polymorphism**: reusability of classes with different inputs giving different outputs following the same logic.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, OOP it's an intuitive and methodical philosofy, making it perfect for newbies, that's why I started with Python. 
Not just for being a OOP but because it's a multi-paradigm and multi-functional language too and it's one of the top examples of OOP philosofy, it's simple, intuitive yet powerful!
